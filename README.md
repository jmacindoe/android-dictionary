A playground for me to try out Android Jetpack components. The app is a basic Chinese-English dictionary.

Technologies used:
- Jetpack Navigation
- Jetpack Lifecycle and ViewModel
- Room
- Work Manager
- Kotlin coroutines
- [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) for DI
- [Spek](https://www.spekframework.org/) for testing
- [Mockk](https://github.com/mockk/mockk) for mocking
- [Kakao](https://github.com/agoda-com/Kakao) for UI tests

Install the Spek Framework plugin in Android Studio to run the tests.

The dictionary entries are taken from CEDICT which is licensed under CC-BY-SA. Full details at https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict
