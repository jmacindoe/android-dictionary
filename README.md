A playground for me to try out Android Jetpack components. The app is a basic Chinese-English dictionary.

Technologies used:
- Jetpack Navigation
- Jetpack Lifecycle and ViewModel
- Room
- Work Manager
- Kotlin coroutines
- Koin

The dictionary entries are taken from CEDICT which is licensed under CC-BY-SA. Full details at https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cedict
